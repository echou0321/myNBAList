    <h2>Problem Description</h2>
    <p>
      The NBA is one of the most statistics-driven sports leagues, with fans regularly engaging in debates over player performance, legacy, and overall impact. Whether it’s casual conversations or in-depth fantasy league decisions, comparing two players side by side is a common and meaningful activity for many basketball enthusiasts.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, current tools for player comparison often fall short. Websites like <strong>Basketball Reference</strong> provide a wealth of data, but the interface can be overwhelming and unintuitive, especially for newer fans. Similarly, platforms like <strong>StatMuse</strong> allow for player stat lookups via natural language queries but don't offer customizable or shareable side-by-side comparisons.

    <h2>Proposed Application</h2>
    <p>
      This project addresses the need for a more accessible and engaging way to compare NBA players. We’re building a web application that allows users to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Select any two NBA players and view their stats side by side</li>
      <li>Visualize performance across categories such as points, assists, rebounds, and shooting percentages</li>
      <li>Save interesting matchups for future reference</li>
      <li>Share them with others through a direct link</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      By focusing on simplicity, usability, and interactivity, this project aims to improve the experience of exploring NBA data, whether for casual fun, settling a debate, or supporting a favorite player. While the problem may not be a large-scale social issue, it reflects a real gap in how information is accessed and shared in the context of sports and presents an opportunity for a thoughtful technological solution.
