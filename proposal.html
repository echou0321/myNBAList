    <h1>NBA Player Comparison & Prediction Tool</h1>

    <h2>Problem Description</h2>
    <p>
      The NBA is one of the most statistics-driven sports leagues, with fans regularly engaging in debates over player performance, legacy, and overall impact. Whether it’s casual conversations or in-depth fantasy league decisions, comparing two players side by side is a common and meaningful activity for many basketball enthusiasts.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, current tools for player comparison often fall short. Websites like <strong>Basketball Reference</strong> provide a wealth of data, but the interface can be overwhelming and unintuitive, especially for newer fans. Similarly, platforms like <strong>StatMuse</strong> allow for player stat lookups via natural language queries but don't offer customizable or shareable side-by-side comparisons.

    <h2>Proposed Application</h2>
    <p>
      This project addresses the need for a more accessible and engaging way to compare NBA players. We’re building a web application that allows users to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Select any two NBA players and view their stats side by side</li>
      <li>Visualize performance across categories such as points, assists, rebounds, and shooting percentages</li>
      <li>Save interesting matchups for future reference</li>
      <li>Share them with others through a direct link</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      By focusing on simplicity, usability, and interactivity, this project aims to improve the experience of exploring NBA data, whether for casual fun, settling a debate, or supporting a favorite player. While the problem may not be a large-scale social issue, it reflects a real gap in how information is accessed and shared in the context of sports and presents an opportunity for a thoughtful technological solution.

      <h3>Why This App?</h3>
      <p>
          This app stands out by combining detailed NBA player comparisons with interactive fan engagement features like polls and predictions—something traditional stat platforms lack. While sites like NBA.com focus on static stats, our tool adds a social and contextual layer, letting users vote on matchups, save predictions, and view real-time community sentiment. A unique “Matchup Insights” feature delivers smart, auto-generated highlights based on upcoming games, giving fans digestible, game-ready analysis without backend complexity. Designed for casual fans and fantasy players alike, this app transforms raw data into a fun, shareable, and interactive basketball experience that keeps users coming back.
