  <section>
    <h2>Problem Description</h2>
    <p>
      The NBA is one of the most statistics-driven sports leagues, with fans regularly engaging in debates over player performance, legacy, and overall impact. Whether it’s casual conversations or in-depth fantasy league decisions, comparing two players side by side is a common and meaningful activity for many basketball enthusiasts.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, current tools for player comparison often fall short. Websites like <strong>Basketball Reference</strong> provide a wealth of data, but the interface can be overwhelming and unintuitive, especially for newer fans. Similarly, platforms like <strong>StatMuse</strong> allow for player stat lookups via natural language queries but don't offer customizable or shareable side-by-side comparisons.
    </p>

    <h2>Proposed Application</h2>
    <p>
      This project addresses the need for a more accessible and engaging way to compare NBA players. We’re building a web application that allows users to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Select any two NBA players and view their stats side by side</li>
      <li>Visualize performance across categories such as points, assists, rebounds, and shooting percentages</li>
      <li>Save interesting matchups for future reference</li>
      <li>Share them with others through a direct link</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      By focusing on simplicity, usability, and interactivity, this project aims to improve the experience of exploring NBA data, whether for casual fun, settling a debate, or supporting a favorite player. While the problem may not be a large-scale social issue, it reflects a real gap in how information is accessed and shared in the context of sports and presents an opportunity for a thoughtful technological solution.

      <h3>Target Users</h3>
      <p>
        Our webpage’s target audience are basketball fans as our site is based on the NBA. 
        This webpage would have no impact on minority groups, as NBA fans consist of a diverse group of individuals.
        User’s will interact with our site’s portrayal of NBA players, where they can select players to compare head to head by analyzing their performances in categories such as points, assists, rebounds, and shooting percentages. 
        These matchups can be saved to the user’s matchup collection and they can also be debated in the discussion forum of the website. This data will come from the dataset and NBA API which are linked later in the proposal.

      <h3>Interactive Features</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Player Comparison Tool</strong> – The first significant interactive feature is the head to head player comparison tool. This feature is a form of data organization, as we’ll organize player data from our dataset onto the players in the website. The user can select two NBA players that they want to compare and see their stats side by side along with visualizations of the stats. We may add the option to compare more than two players as well. </li>
        <li><strong>Favorite Matchups/Sharing</strong> – The second significant interactive feature is the ability for users to save matchups that they created. We’ll store their matchups in a “Favorite Matchups” section so they don’t have to repeat a matchup they’ve already seen. Users can share their favorite matchups with others through a direct link.</li>
        <li><strong>Discussion Board</strong> – Our final interactive feature will be a discussion board, where users can share their matchups with others and conduct friendly discussions about them. 
        </li>
      </ul>

          <ul>
            <li>Use Case: Real-time and historical player stats, team rosters, schedules, game results, and box scores.</li>
            <li>Real-time updates for upcoming games and player performances</li>
            <li>Season-wise or game-specific granularity supports comparison and prediction logic</li>

            <li>Complements the NBA API by filling in gaps in historical/advanced analytics</li>
            <li>Ideal for creating radar charts or percentile visualizations.</li>

      <h3>Why This App?</h3>
      <p>
        We will develop this application because fans enjoy comparing NBA players, yet the available tools are either too complex or feel outdated. Our goal was to develop a website that would allow users to investigate matchups, bookmark them, and discuss them with others conveniently and enjoyably. We wanted to create something that is both educational and entertaining since, as students and basketball fans, we noticed a gap in the way data is presented. This project offers us an opportunity to apply our knowledge in a real-world setting.
