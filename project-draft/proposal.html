    <h2>Problem Description</h2>
    <p>
      The NBA is filled with fan debates about who the best players are, yet there is no dedicated platform that allows fans to rate and rank players based on their own opinions. While sites like <strong>Basketball Reference</strong> provide extensive stats, they focus on objective data and lack a personalized or community-driven element. Fans have no easy way to express or share how they perceive players across different skill areas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other platforms like <strong>StatMuse</strong> or Reddit allow discussion but don’t offer structured tools for individual player ratings, community rankings, or curated favorites. Inspired by media-focused sites like IMDb and Letterboxd, this project aims to bring a more interactive, opinion-based experience to NBA fans—bridging the gap between cold stats and fan sentiment.

    <h2>Proposed Application</h2>
    <p>
      This project introduces a web application that allows users to rate NBA players across multiple categories, including Shooting, Defense, Playmaking, and Rebounding. Each player will receive an overall community score based on fan ratings, which will be displayed on their profile alongside key stats and a highlight reel.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Rate players from 1 to 10 in multiple skill categories</li>
      <li>View average fan scores and official stats on player pages</li>
      <li>Track rating trends over time with dynamic charts</li>
      <li>Create a profile to build and share a Top 10 Favorite Players list</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      By combining personal expression with interactive data features, the app offers a unique way for fans to engage with the NBA. It goes beyond viewing stats by allowing users to contribute their own evaluations, turning player tracking into a personalized and community-driven experience.

    <h3>Target Users</h3>
    <p>
      Our webpage’s target audience is basketball fans, as our site is centered around the NBA. Since NBA fans come from diverse backgrounds, our site is designed to be inclusive and accessible to all. Users will interact with our version of IMDb for NBA players, where they can vote on the best players in specific categories like shooting, dunking, defense, playmaking, and rebounding. These votes will determine rankings in each category and contribute to an overall player ranking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each NBA player will have a profile page displaying their career averages, current stats, and user-generated rankings. Users can also customize their own profile by adding their “Top 10 favorite players” and creating custom teams using actual NBA players. These teams can then be compared with others to see which is stronger.
